                    <article class="text">Happiness is subjective in many ways. You have the option to influence and
                        control
                        your attitude, and you can choose how you view the obstacles in your life. Are they a
                        hinderance, or a blessing in disguise? Are you going to learn from the obstacle you were faced
                        with, or are you going to dwell on it? Many times, that decision is up to you to make. Just as
                        much as outlook influences our daily levels of general happiness, though, so does the way we
                        live our average life. The physical and mental aspects of any person's being have to be
                        harmoniously balanced in order for any true "peace." One does not matter more than the other.
                        That being said, it is sometimes easier to take care of the physical aspect than it is the
                        mental one. Our physical surroundings and conduct is what affects our mental health the most--
                        they both rely on one another.
                        It's also important to note that no person is alike, and that subsequently neither is any path.
                        What makes someone else happy may not make you happy (and vice versa). Someone may achieve
                        something faster than you did, but that does not essentially mean that they worked harder for it
                        or that you didn't deserve what you thought would make you happy. The universe has a way of
                        planning things out for you-- often times, the missed opportunity is just an opening door
                        towards a better one.

                    <article class="text">"Do I live in the present moment?"

                        In a way, we are not taught to accept our thoughts but to fight against them. The best way to
                        accept thoughts is through surrender. When you give up and accept what is happening to you in
                        the present moment, it is then that great changes begin to occur in your life, however, if you
                        resist, you will be in a constant loop of emptiness in which you will unconsciously feel
                        yourself a and again.

                        When we continually think about the past, without knowing it, we dive into a sea of ​​worries
                        and constantly relive those situations in our mind in a random way, that is why our thoughts
                        travel from here to there through our mind without a fixed course, generating In your body the
                        feeling of discomfort. However, when we constantly think about the future, we begin to notice
                        anxiety and some stress due to the simple fact of not being able to control what will happen.
                        Now, what happens if we think about the present? Although perhaps the most appropriate question
                        is what if instead of thinking about the present moment, we simply live it? And you will ask
                        yourself and how do you live in the present moment while still thinking? Well, through the
                        sensations. Feel free to feel what you are feeling, pay attention to those sensations that your
                        body is reproducing at this moment, what do you feel? Keeping our mind in the present helps us
                        feel free, since we are consciously accepting what is happening to us at this time.
